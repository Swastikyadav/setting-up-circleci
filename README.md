# CircleCI: Continuous Integration and Delivery

When we work on software, changes get integrated continuously, and there comes the word `Continuous Integration`.

CircleCI ensures that when a PR is raised with code changes, it does not break our tests.

This repo is dedicated to setting up circleci and fixing issues if any arises.
